//THE OBJECT OF MY AFFECTION: OBJECTS
//IN CLASS OBJECT EXERCISES

// For any methods that we didn't cover, please refer to the Object Documentation.
// Please console.log("Question#") followed by console.log(yourAnswer) after each question.
// If you would like, practice using document.write() as well. Use any elements you like!
// ==========================================================================

// 1. Create an object called "me" that describes you with your name, city, and job title.

//console.log("Question 1");
//console.log(yourAnswer);

// 2. To your "me" object, add a key of "family" with the value being an array of three of your family members.
// Example of desired output: { name: 'Bob Smith',
//                              city: 'Denver',
//                              jobTitle: 'professional wrestler',
//                               family: ['Joan', 'Kyle', 'Hank'] }

// 3. Using the "me" object, use two different methods of accessing your city.

// Use the following Object for questions 4-9:

// (Feel free to make up the titles. And the authors. Have fun. No pressure.)
// Example of desired array: [ youHadMeAtWoof, bangkokHaunts, theCatcherInTheRye]
// Example of desired object: {title: "You Had Me at Woof", author: "Julie Klum", pages: 207}
// Final desired result:

// 16. To each book object variable, add a key of "dateRead" with a value of the year you read the book.
